title: JS development in 2025
date: 2025-01-01
---

Recently I talked to other software engineers looking to build some simple apps,
and recommended RedwoodJS as a simple starting point (based on [this earlier 
post](/app-building-in-2023-2024)). Since these folks haven't written production
JavaScript in recent years, I realized that there were quite a few decisions to
make and understand... many of which I didn't *really* understand myself either,
despite working in JavaScript more seriously the last 5 years (and casually the
5 years prior).

So, this post is an attempt to summarize the state of JavaScript development 
(abbreviated JS below) going into 2025. Think of its target audience as any of
these personas: a college new grad eager to jump into the industry; a vetern to 
programming who has been spared from needing to write JS thus far; or someone
who, like me, has worked with JS for a while, but at this point feel [almost too
afraid to ask](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/afraid-to-ask-andy) "why?"

If any of those descriptions sounds like you, read on!

## Summary

This post will run through an explanation of the following checklist and table. 
Most of it can be summarized by the phrase **glorious chaos**; the table (and 
linked sections below it) will also try to explain some recommendations and why
to navigate through that chaos.

1. [ ] Use `nvm` to install `node`
2. [ ] Run `corepack enable` to allow packages to specify their package managers and node versions
3. [ ] Read the rest of the table below

<a name="r"></a>
⬇️  NOTE: "Recommendation" options denoted by (R) are supported out-of-the-box by
RedwoodJS.

| Layer/Decision | "Why is this even needed?!" | Recommendation | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Run the code/** |
| Target Version | JS evolved over time, and many things from its syntax to keywords have changed significantly. We need to decide on a baseline version for this interpretation standard | `ES2022`? [(R)](#r) | Anything ES6 (aka `ES2015`) and later will have the most significant and useful improvements. `ES2022` balances between modern features and broad compatibility, [expanded below](#target-version) |
| Backend Server | There are lots of language options for the server such as Java/Kotlin, Python, Rust, etc; even within JS, several options exist today (`node, deno, bun`). We need to pick something to run the server code | Use `nvm` to install `node` at `v22` | Node still has significant market share, and therefore a significant amount of community support to help you debug. For [most of 2025](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) the long-term supported (LTS) `node` version will be `v22`, which has enhanced performance with better TypeScript integration; [expanded below](#backend-server) |
| Frontend UI | JS itself doesn't make it easy to write user interfaces. Many UI frameworks exist to make this easier, so we need to pick one | `react` at `v18.3` [(R)](#r) | Huge ecosystem to get community help and learn from examples. `v18` has been out [since 2022](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18) and `v18.3` adds helpful warnings for upgrading to `v19` as mentioned in the latter's [upgrade guide](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide) |
| Frontend Web Bundler | Unlike many other programming languages, JS may need to run on browsers, and source files need to be delivered there somehow, [expanded below](#frontend-web-bundling). We need to pick a tool to help do this | `vite` [(R)](#r) | Fast build times, native support for TypeScript; see the "Dynamic vs. Static Typing" row later in this table for more on TypeScript |
| Package Manager | You'll almost never build purely from scratch, and instead usually use libraries (packages) that others have published. <br></br> `node` ships with a manager `npm`, but there are also alternatives like `pnpm` and `yarn` | `pnpm` | `pnpm` is mature enough, benefits from [efficient disk usage](https://pnpm.io/motivation), and has good dependency and workspace management |
| **Write the code/** |
| Dynamic vs. Static Typing | JS is dynamically typed, which allows for faster code writing than statically typed languages; static typing helps reduce errors, which speeds up development in the long run. We need to pick a side to err on | Static typing, using TypeScript at [the latest version](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) [(R)](#r) | For someone new to JS, static typing will force a more explicit understanding; for everyone, the benefits (and tradeoffs) of static typing are [expanded below](#typing-typescript) |
| Linter | Linting further reduces errors, [expanded below](#linting) | ESLint with `typescript-eslint` | Combined JS/TS linting with type-aware rules, to help new and veteran JS programmers alike reduce errors |
| Formatter | Languages like Go provide default formatters like `gofmt`, but JS doesn't | Prettier [(R)](#r) | An auto-formatter helps keep a consistent code style, so you can save energy from thinking about "correct" formatting to devote to the business logic instead. [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) is up-and-coming, but let's go with Prettier as a proven and opinionated tool for now |

## Glorious chaos

"Glorious chaos" is neither praise nor critique for the language, but simply a
reflection of how JS has evolved in a distributed way over the years, and an 
explanation to brace yourself for its tradeoffs.

The glory comes from using a language this can run everywhere; the chaos is the
consequent complexity that you'll need to tame. This post will, hopefully, help
you navigate through it all and emerge with your sanity intact.

## Longer explanation

At the end of the day, the "Recommendation" options may not always be feasible
if the framework you want to use simply necessitates different options. With 
`corepack enable` run, you'll usually use the same package manager and node
version as the framework you're building on anyway. So this column really means
a recommendation when starting a new project today.

### <a name="target-version"></a>Target Version

JS's language specification is abbreviated ES for ECMAScript, whose [namesake
Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) elaborates on the
history. To over-simplify a bit, we can think of these as synonymous for the
purpose of the rest of this post:
* JavaScript (JS)
* ECMAScript (ES)

For a language like Python, it's **both a language and implementation**, in that
python.org defines the language specification *and* provides a default 
implementation CPython, elaborated in [this Reddit 
thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1czzg57/understanding_what_cpython_actually_is_has/).
That allows for a more straightforward standardization process.

In contrast, JS is *just* a language, because there's no prescriptive
implementation dictating what browser or backend you (or your users) ought to
be using. But over time, it inevitably had to evolve to fill in various gaps,
like how to handle async processing (callbacks -> promises -> async functions)
and what default functions exist on `Array` objects.

Put another way, JS has had a distributed evolution, from different engines 
implementing a language specification, that happened simultaneously with the
language specification's evolution itself:

* Runtime engines include `JavaScriptCore, SpiderMonkey, V8`, each of which 
  are used in some browsers and backends
* The language specification has evolved as part of a committee called 
  [TC39](https://tc39.es/)

Long story short, the choice of `ES2022` is a balance between "new-enough"
language specifications, and old-enough to have enough browser support.

### <a name="backend-server"></a>Backend Server
Language choice is worth a post itself, so we'll assume JS just for brevity.
While it's not a deciding factor, having "one" language (ignoring the "target 
versions" consideration!) is a helpful simplification.

Node has different versions (just like Python, Rust, etc.), and the packages 
you want to use may target a minimum requirement that necessitates a higher one
than what your machine currently has installed... or a lower one. 

So, `nvm` helps quickly switch between versions. This also helps resolve
seemingly random permission issues that may arise from otherwise installing
`node` globally, as explained in [this StackOverflow
question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73156323/internal-error-eacces-permission-denied-symlink-lib-node-modules-corepack).

Finally, the choice for `v22` is similar to the above one for `ES2022`:
something new enough to be officially well-supported, but not so new that there
are still bugs to be ironed out.

### <a name="frontend-web-bundling"></a>Frontend Web Bundling

Unlike the execution of JS on the backend that has direct access to source
files, frontend JS execution requires the code to somehow be delivered to users'
browsers. This has evolved quite a bit over time, in both the way a programmer
needs to separate their modules

[This article by Devlin Glasman on Modules and Bundling](https://8thlight.com/insights/a-history-of-javascript-modules-and-bundling-for-the-post-es6-developer)
does a great job elaborating on the history over time.

The choice for `vite` is due to its speed and plugin system.

### <a name="typing-typescript"></a>Typing and TypeScript

Keep in mind that a required tradeoff is that Static Typing will reject some 
valid code [by design](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/04wi/lectures/13-dynamic-vs-static-types.html),
which may necessitate writing the code differently.

For the latest version of TypeScript: features tend to be additive, so picking 
whatever is the latest version should be safe. Just be sure to install at the 
project scope and not global scope!

Some helpful options are off by default, and need to be enabled from a
configuration file called `tsconfig.json`. [This 
article](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tsconfig-cheat-sheet) provides a good 
initial config file. I like it because it has `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` enabled
by default, which passes my bar for a thoughtful starting point.

### <a name="linting"></a>Linting

Linting is very closely related. It helps maintain clean coding conventions,
which similar to static typing will reject more buggy code at the consequence of
also rejecting some benign code. This is usually still worth the tradeoff!

### Other considerations

The above considerations aren't the only decisions you may need to make. The
glorious chaos of JS development means there are even more rabbit holes you can
dive into.

I offer some shorter recommendations and my current explanations. They may still
turn out to be important considerations for your app building experience, but I
expect them to be more framework- or project-driven decisions not always with
your control.

| Decision | 2025 Recommendation | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Importing Modules | (Nothing to recommend) | Since you don't have direct control over how others publish their modules, just be aware that [there are many ways to import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#importing_features_into_your_script)! |
| Exporting Modules | [Export as ES module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#exporting_module_features) [(R)](#r) | |
| Client \<-> Server Protocol | GraphQL [(R)](#r) | |
| IDE/Editor | VSCode | Strong TypeScript support, integrated debugging. I use `vim` myself, but would recommend VSCode as a much more feature-fledged IDE for someone totally new |
| Testing Framework | Storybook for UI [(R)](#r), Jest for everything else | |
| Styling | TailwindCSS [(R)](#r) plus a corresponding component library like flowbite | |
