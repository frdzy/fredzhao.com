As my Dreamhost account drew near its annual renewal date, I took the
opportunity to look into other hosting options.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) was an obvious winner because of its
unbeatable price: free! I then followed [this blog post by Joshua
Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) to set up this site
using Jekyll + Poole.

The preview looked great!

### Custom domain name for Project Page

The only tricky part was mapping from my domain onto my [Project
Page](https://github.com/frdzy/fredzhao.com) and not my GitHub [User
Page](https://frdzy.github.io). A quick Google search for the term `github
project page custom domain` then turned up the exact article I needed, ["Custom
domain for GitHub project pages"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9082499/custom-domain-for-github-project-pages).

One point of confusion I had was that, in all of the articles, they explained
that the DNS records should point to the GitHub User Page, but it wasn't clear
how this connected to the Project Page. The second-highest answer on the Stack
Overflow page explained this more in detail:

> For the CNAME record, point www to yourusername.github.io. Note the trailing
> full stop. Note also, this is the username, not the project name. You don't
> need to specify the project name yet. Github will use the CNAME file to
> determine which project to ship content for.

After following the steps there, it looks like the changes will take some time
to propagate.

### Config adjustments for Project Page

When I previewed the new page on the `github.io` domain, I noticed the CSS
resources were not fetched. [The Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/#project-page-url-structure)
explained how to fix this, so to manually patch up all the occurrences that 
didn't match up with the documentation, I ran the following find-and-replace 
script:

```
$ sed -i -e 's:baseurl }}\([^{/]\):baseurl }}/\1:' \
  $(git grep --name-only "baseurl }}[^{/]")
```

As a caveat, I had to use two different configurations for `_config.yml`
depending on if I wanted the github.io page or my actual personal domain to
display correctly. My current working theory is that it's impossible to both, so
the main goal is to achieve the following

To demonstrate the changes I made in patch form (first displayed correctly on
github.io, then on my own domain):

```
# username.github.io/projectname (frdzy.github.io/fredzhao.com)
-baseurl:  / +baseurl:  /projectname

# mydomain.com (fredzhao.com)
-baseurl:  /projectname
```

### Testing everything

As a sanity check, I made sure these all worked (including serving up the page
with the correct CSS):

* Clicking on a post permalink Clicking back to the homepage Clicking "Older" to
* see an older post Clicking "Older" again to see an even older post Clicking
* "Newer" to step back Clicking "Newer" to step back one more time Loading
* `/atom.xml` Loading `/derp` (which doesn't exist) and make sure the "Head back
* home" works
