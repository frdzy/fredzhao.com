In this post, I'll walk through setting up a personal tennis court reservation and scheduling
system, continued from [part 2](airtennis-part-2-of-3-tennis-scheduling-and-reminders-on-airtable).

<h3 id="step-1">Step 1: Create an Airtable account and copy the template</h3>

Go to [this link](https://www.airtable.com/universe/exp2vRYvl9x1xHOKA/airtennis) and click "Use
template" near the top of the page. If you don't already have an Airtable account, it will prompt
you to create one.

Before clicking "Use template", you can also click on "Explore the base" to get a preview of the
tables that will be created for you as part of the template.

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2: Fill in your own information</h3>

Now you can start to add in your local Courts, existing Reservations, and existing Schedules, in
each of the 3 respective tables!

Start by going to the "Reservations" table and creating an entry here with today's date. We can
then use it in the next step.

<h3 id="step-3">Step 3: Try out the Form to schedule matches</h3>

After you create some upcoming Reservations, they should show up in the "Open" view for that table.

Now, switch go to the "Scheduling" table and click on the form view called "Match Schedule with Me".

Find the preview button at the top called "Open form" and click it to see the actual form. When you
scroll down to the form field called "Availability / Reservation", the "Add" button should now show
the Reservation we just created.

<h3 id="step-4">
  Step 4: Create email Automations for form submission and pre-match reminder
</h3>

Finally, we can add some Automations to finish this setup! Click on the tab at the top of the page
called "Automations" to get started. Here are the two main ones to set up:

**Notify me on form submissions**

- Trigger: When a form is submitted: select the table "Scheduling" and pick [the form from step 3]
- Actions:
  - Conditional logic (from the "Advanced logic" section): If Reservation length > 0
    - Action: Send an email to use the "Reservation" entry
  - Otherwise
    - Action: Send an email to use the "Manual Time" entry from the form

**Reminder emails**

- Trigger: At a scheduled time: Every 1 day at 9am local time
- Actions:
  - Action: Find records from the table "Scheduling" using the Conditions of...
    - "Status" is any of Confirmed or Tentative
    - and "Player Email" is not empty
    - and "Date" is tomorrow GMT
  - Repeat for each in [List of records from the previous action]
    - Action: Send email to use the "Player Email" field, and your own email in the "Reply to" field

<h3 id="step-5">Step 5: Try it out!</h3>

Now you have everything fully set up. Try it out, and I might see you on the courts!
