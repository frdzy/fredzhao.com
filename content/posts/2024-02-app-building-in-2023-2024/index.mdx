My last few posts talked about [Airtennis](airtennis-part-1-of-3-challenges-of-scheduling-tennis-in-sf): 
why this Calendly alternative is helpful, and how to set it up.

Its implementation atop Airtable has been a good enough solution for my personal court tracking,
from [quick schema updates to some simple Automation 
reminders](airtennis-part-2-of-3-tennis-scheduling-and-reminders-on-airtable). And best of all, 
it's free!

Lately, I've been trying to extend it for team tracking, as I've been co-captaining a USTA team 
since January. This is where I'm running into scaling issues.

To properly utilize Airtable, each teammate should both be an Airtable user, and install the 
Airtable native app. But because our team coordination already uses a combination of WhatsApp, 
texting, and email, it's a tougher sell to ask people to alter their habits by creating yet another
account and install yet another app.

So, being a software engineer, I've been looking at the best alternative: building my own app. This
post is an exploration of what the possible options are based on my research to date, at the end of
February 2024.

## Goals

Before jumping into specific details, let's list out some goals for this app. In priority order...

1. **Easy for users**. The main goal is to make it easy for players to organize. If this isn't 
   reached, the whole exercise will be pretty pointless.
2. **Simple infra, extensible UI**. I still have a fulltime job, so I don't want to spend time
   thinking about infrastructure and scaling. But I DO want to hone my product thinking and UI
   development skills, so the frontend layer should be totally customizable.
3. **Low cost**. The result should be cheap in both maintenance time and money. Free is best, 
   but if I need to pay $10 a month, that's an easy cost to stomache. (I'm sure that when/if the
   scale of this toy app blows up, there will be ways to crowdsource the funding, so in the short
   term this is definitely more about minimizing maintenance time.)

### Goals for users

What do I mean by "easy for users"? This section is important to sketch out because it will motivate
a lot of high level decisions.

To brainstorm a bit:
* I don't want to require people to install yet another app. Is it possible to have all of the 
  UI run off of a chatbot? Or should I just go with a mobile-friendly website and call it a day?
* Who is my first set of target audience? Is it all of the competitive tennis players in UTR and 
  USTA leagues? Or just USTA captains?

Here are some preliminary decisions just so that we can go into picking an implementation:
1. Start with a mobile-friendly website, use emails to send out confirmations and reminders
   1. This will cover the largest possible audience, and be the easiest to build for me
2. Start with the generic use case of two people trying to schedule a singles match (UTR matches or practices)
   1. This will help me get something useful out the door, and can always be added to later

With that out of the way, let's take a look at how to go about building this.

## Let's build an app

As the saying goes, "The future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed yet." Apps can
give people a lot of power in terms of organization, influence, and even making a living. But there
are so many ways to build an app that it's quite mind boggling.

So here's an attempt to break down the decision making into some coarse steps:

### 1. Code or nah?

The first decision is actually pretty meta: do we actually NEED to write code? The best battle is
the one not fought. Maybe I can just pay for a solution?

| Criteria \ Option | Write code | Nah |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --- |
| Easy for users | Maybe | + |
| Simple infra, extensible UI | + | - Extensibility depends on platform |
| Low cost | = Costs more time | = Costs more money |

"Nah" is pretty powerful nowadays. The spectrum goes from totally packaged solutions (e.g. Calendly,
Shopify) to website builders (Squarespace) to app building (Airtable, Retool, Thunkable, Webflow).

That final category gives a lot more customization options by allowing SOME customized code to be
written, which puts them more into the "low-code" category.

But since I do want to maximize extensibility, let's decide to **write some real code**.

### 2. Where should the code run?

When I first made a personal website during college, I paid something like $5/month for a Virtual
Private Server on a dedicated webhost. It was a Wordpress site on Dreamhost, I think?

Nowadays, "serverless" is all the rage, due to two important updates over the 15 years since I was
in school:
1. Frontends have become very powerful! So a user can navigate to different pages purely from React
   transitions, as opposed to navigate to separate pages each served from a PHP request 
2. So backends really just need to call functions to connect the frontend actions to backend
   database reads/writes. It's pretty overkill to have a reserved server (even if it's a virtual 
   one) just to answer some sporadic traffic a few times a week. Hobbyist projects definitely fall 
   into this category!

| Criteria \ Option | Servers | Serverless |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --- |
| Simple infra, extensible UI | + | + scheduled functions: depends |
| Low cost | = | + |

The one exception is that having an actual server would easily allow me to run scheduled functions 
(as opposed to just answering external requests), whereas in serverless hosting, that's often a 
separate offering with a separate pricing tier.

To minimize cost, let's go with **serverless** since many providers have very generous free tiers, 
and see how far we can get.

### 3. Who do I use?

The current hotness seems to be the JAMstack: JavaScript, APIs, and markup. JavaScript allows
frontend and backend logic to be in the same language; APIs provide the bridge between the UI and 
the database; and markup is the final presentation.

I went with the first option here, but also listed a second option for future consideration.

1. RedwoodJS on Netlify
2. NextJS on Vercel

| Criteria \ Option | RedwoodJS on Netlify | NextJS on Vercel |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --- |
| Getting started   | +          | ? Haven't tried |
| Frontend Customizability | =   | ? Haven't tried |
| Backend Customizability | =    | ? Haven't tried |

In short, the pro AND con of RedwoodJS is that it has a bunch of things "out of the box". The pro is
that it's very easy to get started, but the con is that anything that breaks in its package are
tougher to debug. It also has some conventions to learn, such as
[Cells](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/6.x/cells#how-does-redwood-know-a-cell-is-a-cell), which creates
magical behaviors that are not very intuitive.

That said, I ended up going with it because it's very fast to get started, and also included several 
other library choices I would have picked myself anyway:

* TypeScript types, to give more realtime feedback of autocompletion and mistake catching
* Prisma to connect the API <-> database layers
* GraphQL to connect the client <-> API layers
* TailwindCSS for client styling
* Jest and Storybook for testing (I'm not remotely close to being at the stage of needing tests yet,
  but these both make sense to me)

It also made a bunch of choices I have less context and opinions about:

* vite: Looks like it helps optimize code bundling; this is just not something I ever had to deal
  with in my career so far
* Babel: Transpiling; I vaguely know why this is important, but have never needed to evaluate
  a provider myself

With Netlify's free tier, I randomly picked a database provider of Planetscale (Railway was another
alternative, but its free tier caps usage minutes each month). Supabase is another name that comes
up frequently.

In all, the cost is now roughly $15 / year for the domain name, which is much cheaper than the
per-month hosting I used back in college.

For comparison, that's the same cost as this blog itself, which has been slightly simpler -- since 
it's just a static site, I can serve it from Github Pages, as mentioned in the [very first blog
post](/hello-github-project-page). I've since moved off of Jekyll and onto Gatsby, but that has a
similar underlying process
1. a one-time "expensive" build+deploy step happens each time I commit to the repo
   1. blog: run "gatsby deploy" locally
   2. app: done by Netlify up to its monthly free tier limit
2. a much cheaper service cost is absorbed by the hosting platform
   1. blog: hosted by Github Pages
   2. app: done by a combination of Netlify's frontend cloud and serverless functions
3. (a side note: data storage)
   1. blog: the frontend content IS the data, it's statically generated so no need for a database
   2. app: free tier of Planetscale to store dynamic, user-created data

## 4. Where is the trend going?

With the above decisions, I have a decent setup that I'm building off of. Cool!
Now, stepping back a bit, here are some observations I've gathered:

### The playbook for service providers

There's a common playbook. Every provider seems to start somewhere to gain a foothold, and then 
expand "vertically" to other parts of the layers involved:

* Airtable: started as database with very flexible filters, expanding over the last years to app
  building, especially within teams and enterprises
* Retool, Thunkable: started with app building, also started to add to data storage
* Webflow, Squarespace, Shopify: start with a very specific type of app, and start customizing
  from there
* Netlify: started with build+deploy+hosting, also growing into "Connect" to do data storage

### It's all just data... with useful indexes

When I squint my eyes a bit, it's all "just" data.

In the case of my blog, it's a "single user write, multi user read" model; in the case of the 
tennis tracking app, it's "multi user write and read", so the app needs to add some complexity 
around **who's** allowed to read/write **which** pieces of data.

The data alone is not sufficient as an app; it's what users do with it that matters. A blog is a
most-recent feed of posts; the tennis tracking app is a most-recent-and-filtered view of 
schedules and reservations. 

This simplification isn't meant to trivialize apps, but instead to highlight the power of a good
index over a canonical and durable form of data store. 

Everything else (build, deploy, hosting, good frontend user experience) are the necessary
scaffolding to help the end user maximize their ability to use all of this indexed data.

As a comparison, a vague statement like "It's all just data" is akin to "It's all written on 
paper", without elaborating on all the different ways humanity has learned to produce them (books,
magazines, and other form of media), consume them (libraries, e-books), distribute them (fax, email,
air-dropped pamphlets), and more.

### What is my purpose

As a software engineer, I have the entire range of tools at my disposal. On one end of the spectrum,
I could embrace the no-code and low-code solutions (as I had done so far with Airtable); on the
other end I could go really raw and write a bunch of things in scratch and host it directly on AWS.
Where I ended up is somewhere in the middle, perhaps weighed slightly towards the "raw" side.

But I just want to remind myself that, at the end of the day, my purpose is to get out there with
other tennis players and hit, as well as help THEM hit more with other people. It's not stay inside
to write code all day.
