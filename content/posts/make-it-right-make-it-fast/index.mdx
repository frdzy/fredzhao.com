title: Make It Right, Make It Fast

It's time to make the Project pages a lot more robust.

Here's the rough tradeoff I had made in not starting with a more
well-engineered solution originally:

- (+) Since I haven't done much frontend development, being lazy means I don't
  have to learn anything new beyond what I'm already familiar with
- (-) In each blog/page, I have to manually reference filepaths to load libraries
- (-) In those pages, I also have to manually track those dependencies and ensure
  they're up to date
- (-) Those libraries would also have to be loaded into the global namespace

Today I'll fix those minus signs! But first, a quick word on why this didn't
make sense to do earlier.

<blockquote>Make it work -> Make it right -> Make it fast</blockquote>

I recently heard a wise saying at work -- **"make it work, make it right, make
it fast"** -- as a 3-step process to take a difficult project and make it easy.
It's important to follow it in that specific ordering, for two reasons.

The first reason is pragmatic: the functionality of a program drives everything
else. The program's correctness and speed still matter, but they're irrelevant
if the functionality doesn't even exist yet.

The bigger reason is psychological: it's a lot more fun to realize an idea as
quickly as possible, even if that means it starts off looking super rough. It's
not that fleshing out its details is necessarily less fun, but those things
often tend to get way more involved. Breaking up a huge idea into small steps of
ideas makes the whole thing feel a lot more tenable.

In this vein, the sole "(+)" in my tradeoff list above was crucial in its own
right. I didn't really know what exactly I needed until I built on the prototype
(answer: React on a static page); and it was very liberating to give myself
permission to hack up something that works without worrying about expanding the
scope and introducing more changes that, while they would be nice to have, were
simply distractions at the time.

But now the time has come to follow up on the next two steps! :)

- Make it work: Continue to render pages with React as I did for the first
  project
- Make it right: I should be able to `require()` modules
- Make it fast: I should be able to run a command line script to build and
  bundle files for web, and reuse the same common files

## The solution

The solution I settled on is Webpack. It handles everything I want above and
also makes room for future possibilities, like [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader).

Here are the steps I took:

1. Read a bunch of articles (see [References](#references) section at the end of
   this article)
2. Decide on a good-enough folder structure (`src -> build`)
3. Convert the existing source files to use `require()`
4. Follow the tutorial steps until I can run `webpack` without errors
5. Finally, convert references to point to the new folder structure

Step 4. took the longest time, which is to be expected since I've never worked
with Webpack before. One error in particular took a bit of time to hunt down:

```
ReferenceError: [BABEL] ... Unknown option: direct.presets
```

In my case, it turned out that my `package.json` referenced preset libraries
that were too old, and **their** version of `babel` didn't support the `presets`
attribute. Updating `package.json` to use a later version fixed that up.

## Looking forward

Long term, I also want to be able to systematically track the progress of my
projects over time. This means, for each project, I should be able to:

- Make it work better:
  - Add blog post with a snapshot of the code, taken when the blog post is written
- Make it more right:
  - Maintain a Project page for the code, but as an updating repository
- Make it faster:
  - I should only need a single command to both launch the Jekyll server and
    rerun webpack to rebuild files as they change

Research steps:

First I tried to pick between Browserify and Webpack. My conclusion was that
this decision was pretty arbitrary -- most of the arguments cover topics I
simply haven't experienced firsthand -- so I picked the one that supports
React Hot Loader for future Option Value.

From here, I looked up a few more articles to suit my specific needs of (1)
supporting a static site and (2) creating multiple chunks for multiple pages.
From these readings, I realized that the second consideration may also change
in the future if/when I convert this blog into a single page app, but I'm
satisfied with the results for now.
