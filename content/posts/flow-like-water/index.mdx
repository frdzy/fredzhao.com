Over the last few months, I've been relearning how to swim. This has been both a
physical and mental challenge.

Physically speaking, I've been surprised that my foundations from distance
running have helped very little in swiming. This comes more than 20 years after 
the last time I took swimming lessons at the local YMCA, a period of high
physical demand which frankly traumatized my younger self who had much less
stamina than today.

Since then, I built up a better base from cross country (one season in high 
school and another in college) and several marathons as an adult. So it has 
been humbling to see that none of this helped _intrinsically_, and there is 
still much to improve in simply swimming technique:

1. Stay balanced (horizontal) in the water to minimize drag
2. Breathe without lifting my head up (which also contributes to balance)
3. Use arms more than legs for more efficient propulsion

<div style={{ 
  display: 'flex', 
  flexWrap: 'wrap',
  gap: '20px', 
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  margin: '20px 0',
  width: '100%'
}}>
  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 300px', minWidth: '300px', maxWidth: '600px' }}>
    <WaterPlankSimulation plankAngle={10} />
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 300px', minWidth: '300px', maxWidth: '600px' }}>
    <WaterPlankSimulation plankAngle={0} />
  </div>
</div>

The mental challenges are very closely related to the physical ones:

1. Relax my breathing -- while my body was _physically_ capable of swimming with
   fewer breaths, I still inclined to breathing very often to quell my innate
   fear of the water
2. Flow with the water, don't fight it -- I'm still in the mindset of "don't 
   drown" and have been prone to trying to take faster strokes, but that would 
   reduce glide efficiency over the course of whole laps

These last points have felt reflective to work and life in general: it's much
better to stay relaxed and understand where to go with the flow, than tighten
and struggle in the face of seeming hurdles.

So as I continue my struggle in the pool, I also look forward to the continued
growth that swimming brings to my adult self.
