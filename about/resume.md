* Basic competency in full-stack development, from internal hackathons and 3 years of internal tools
* Passion for teaching, honed by mentoring teammates, answering internal forum questions, and volunteering

## Relevant Work Experience

❤️ My proudest projects are "Post Data Model Refactor" (based on external and internal impact) and "Internal Notification Management" (based on personal alignment). Exact metrics are omitted, but orders of magnitude are provided.

### Software Engineer, Facebook

> Menlo Park, California (July 2012 - Present)

* *General Contributions*
  * Conducted ~300 interviews, with focus on product architecture
  * Participated in quorum for post-interview debrief sessions
* Recruiting Products: July 2019 - Current
  * **Current Events** (tech lead, cross-team)
    * Built data model and ingested current events, coordinated with teammates to surface them to relevant recruiter tools. Result: positive employee feedback, xx incremental net hires of relevant candidates.
  * **Resume Parsing and Migration** (paired with another serverside engineer)
    * Refactored a pipeline for resume ingestion/update operations. Result: sped up parsing by xx% and zero regressions through refactor.
  * **Sourcing Context** (member, product team)
    * Experimented with new UI to store requisition information in sourcer workflows. Result: did not ship due to low feature retention.
  * *Team-wide communication norms*
    * Pushed for team best practices in asynchronous communication norms. Result: recognition by manager and teammates for well-documented discussions and decisions.
* Productivity Tools: July 2017 - July 2019
  * ❤️ **Internal Notification Management** (paired with front-end engineer)
    * Built "Inbox Zero" features, launched suggested settings to proactively reduce notification noise. Result: xx% reduction of notifications over xx% action rate on suggestions.
  * **Tasks** (member, product team)
    * Proposed and built first-class support for project management features in internal task management tool: progress, group by X, sprint planning. Result: x% usage adoption and x% retention.
* Photos Infrastructure / Sharing Infrastructure: July 2012 - July 2017
  * **Album Improvements** (tech lead, cross-platform team)
    * Expanded photo albums as general tools for story organization, made shared albums available on mobile, built upon prior work on post data model (see next project). Result: shipped.
  * ❤️ **Post Data Model Refactor** (tech lead, multi-year cross-org project)
    * Refactored the data model for all sitewide content for users; coordinated effort across other teams, both horizontally (pages, ads, groups) and vertically (news feed, timeline, data analytics). Result: pulled off the original goal, paved the way for efficient cross-platform feature development, caused an acceptable number of x outage events.
  * **Shared Albums** (paired with product engineer)
    * Built data model and some web UIs to ship this feature on web, identified and pre-empted security holes by extrapolating from related product reports. Result: shipped.
  * *Team-wide engineering practices*: 
    * Ramped up and recruited teammates, established oncall process and documentation. Result: many teammates and most practices all outlived my team tenure.

### Software Engineer Intern, Facebook
